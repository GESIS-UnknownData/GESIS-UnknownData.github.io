[Unknown Data - Mining & consolidating research dataset metadata on the web](https://www.dagstuhl.de/ueber-dagstuhl/projekte/unknown-data/)

<br>
The research data is essential to facilitate scientific progress, yet, many valuable datasets are hidden on web sites and small repositories or are hard to find due to insufficient metadata. Not all the scientific or research works are publicaly accesible to everyone and only few researchers pro-actively share dataset metadata through public portals, and it is expensive to access few websites or resources. Therefore, we would like to provide means to automatically discover, extract, and publish metadata about research data that is hidden on the Web or in scholarly publications. 

The objective of the project is to improve findability and re-usability of research data by: 
1. improving metadata quality, in particular with respect to authority and use of existing datasets and 
2. uncovering datasets that are not yet reflected in public data repositories and registries. 

<br>
Main approach in out task are:
1. utilizing data citations from scholarly articles and web pages to collect metadata about relevant datasets, 
2. discovering datasets and their context by crawling web pages, 
3. consolidating metadata by linking information from domain-specific databases, 
4. facilitating high metadata quality by establishing a discipline-specific curation process, and 
5. ensuring long-term availability of original data sources by archiving relevant web pages. 
<br>

Obtaining metadata about research data directly from web sources and publications is a novel approach, increasing the visibility of “long tail” datasets while at the same time providing crucial insights into the actual use and impact of (known) datasets. The results of this project will benefit two disciplines, computer science and the social sciences, through use case pilots. The DBLP computer science bibliography and the GESIS portals, accessible through GESIS Search, are among the most prestigious and widely-used metadata collections in their respective fields.

Through the project, the effectiveness and efficiency of researchers in common data search use cases will be significantly improved by 
1. creating a centralized and comprehensive collection of metadata about research datasets for the first time in computer science and 
2. fundamentally improving quality and quantity of dataset metadata in the social sciences. 

Dataset citations extracted from web pages or publications are crucial features for assessing the usefulness of research data and thereby can boost its reuse.
